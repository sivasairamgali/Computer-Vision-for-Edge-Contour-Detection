# Computer-Vision-Based Edge Contour Detection
This project is an effort to identify edges in an image through image processing. This project offers a custom Python implementation of the method that makes use of the OpenCV package. With the aid of this project, users can detect edges in their photographs and see those edges at various phases of the algorithm's operation.

Canny Edge Detection, number
This project uses the OpenCV library to implement the Canny edge detection technique in Python. For locating edges in photos, many people employ the Canny edge detection algorithm. Users can use this repository's application to apply the Canny edge detection method to their photographs.

# Usage
Start the.ipynb file and enter the path to your input image in the image directory.

Run the .ipynb file and place your input image's path in the image directory.:

Adjust the parameters in the detect_edges.py file as needed to fine-tune the edge detection.

The output image with detected edges can be viewed by running the cells.
